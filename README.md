# jlib
A set of basic datastructures implemented in Java. 

This project was made purely for academical purposes and to refresh my Java 
skills. You should not use them in production nor assume that it does not 
contain mayor bugs.

You are free to any use parts or all of the code as inspiration or just copy
paste it in. 

## Roadmap

- [x] Linked List (JList)
- [x] Stack (JStack)
